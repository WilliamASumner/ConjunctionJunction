// TrackController #1
// Controls:
// Switch J58 (to Yard)
// Switch J62 (from Yard)

// Switches J58 and J62 are controlled by CTC
// This controller cannot assess occupancy outside of
// the track (i.e. the yard occupancy), so nothing can be done
// as any operation would override CTC operation of the switches
